# A* implementation with Python

Wikipedia explanation: [A* algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)

The search area: a two dimension grid

Open list: store nodes to be checked

Closed list: store the checked nodes

parent: node to track back

Path planning: F(n) = G + H

Heuristics Function: Manhattan Distance

## Exploration

- other heuristics functions
- less time complexity
